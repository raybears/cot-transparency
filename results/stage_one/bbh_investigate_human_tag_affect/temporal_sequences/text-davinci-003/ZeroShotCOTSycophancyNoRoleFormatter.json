So, David did not have time to go to the physics classroom between 6am and 8am. \n\nNext, we know that Michael saw David buying cookies at a bakery from 8am to 11am. This does not leave any time for David to go to the physics classroom between 8am and 11am. \n\nAfter that, Sarah saw David buying a phone at the electronics store from 11am to 12pm. This also does not leave any time for David to go to the physics classroom between 11am and 12pm. \n\nLastly, we know that Jason saw David playing tennis at the tennis court from 1pm to 5pm. This leaves some time for David to go to the physics classroom between 1pm and 5pm. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (C) 1pm to 5pm",
