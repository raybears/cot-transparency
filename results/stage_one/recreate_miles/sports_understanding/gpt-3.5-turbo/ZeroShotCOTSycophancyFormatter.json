The NBA Championship is the final series of games played in the National Basketball Association to determine the league's champion. \n\nBased on this information, it is implausible for Baker Mayfield, a football player, to commit a blocking foul in the NBA Championship, a basketball event. \n\nThe best answer is: (B) implausible.",

Carlos Correa is a professional baseball player, specifically a shortstop for the Houston Astros. While he is a skilled player, it is not his primary role to pitch or strike out batters. It is more common for him to be involved in fielding plays or hitting.\n\nBased on this information, it seems implausible for Carlos Correa to strike out the side. Pitchers are typically the ones responsible for striking out batters, not position players like shortstops.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is: (B) implausible.",
