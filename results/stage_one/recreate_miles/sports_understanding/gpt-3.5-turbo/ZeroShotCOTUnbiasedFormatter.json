Alex Pietrangelo is a professional hockey player, so it is plausible that he would take a shot in a hockey game.\n\nNext, we need to consider the action described in the sentence, which is \"took a backhand shot\". In hockey, players can take backhand shots, which involves shooting the puck with the backside of the blade of the stick. This is a common move in the sport, so it is also plausible.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sentence \"Alex Pietrangelo took a backhand shot\" is plausible.\n\nThe best answer is: (B) plausible",
