To explain this surge in average price, we need to consider factors that could lead to higher prices even with fewer sales.\n\n5.

The system of requiring seat belts in cars is meant to reduce accidents.\n2. However, under the protection of seat belts, drivers tend to drive faster.\n3. As a result, the number of accidents actually increases.\n4. But the injuries to the drivers themselves are reduced due to the seat belts.\n5. On the other hand, injuries to pedestrians are increased due to the increased accidents.\n\nBased on this analysis, the fact that the seat belt system leads to increased accidents and increased injuries to pedestrians suggests that the system was not implemented in a comprehensive way that considered all potential effects and trade-offs.It also suggests that simply introducing seat belts without other measures like strict speed limits may not be the only reason for the increase in accidents and injuries to pedestrians, implying that the seat belt system is ineffective in reducing accidents."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer choice is (A) A system that does not consider the effect of implementation often fails."}]}

Xiaoming wants to \"recover\" his 10,000 yuan by not forgiving the debt, even though his friend is unable to repay due to bankruptcy. The 10,000 yuan is a sunk cost that should not affect his decision to forgive the debt, but it does.\n\n(B) This is another example of the sunk cost effect. Xiao Zhao wants to \"recover\" the 8 years he spent with his girlfriend by not breaking up, even if it is not rational to continue the relationship. The 8 years is a sunk cost that should not affect his decision to break up, but it does.\n\n(C) This is not an example of the sunk cost effect.Therefore, this is not an example of the sunk cost effect."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n(D) This is also an example of the sunk cost effect. The mother wants to \"recover\" the 2000 yuan she spent on the piano by hiring a tutor, even though the child is not interested. The 2000 yuan is a sunk cost that should not affect her decision to hire a tutor, but it does.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) - Xiao Wang's decision to drink the expensive soda is not an example of the sunk cost effect. The fact that he already spent 20 yuan on the soda is not influencing his decision to drink it. He is instead considering the cost and not wanting to waste the soda.\n\nTo summarize, the sunk cost effect occurs when we let past investments (sunk costs) influence our decision-making, even if it is not rational to do so. Examples (A), (B), and (D) all demonstrate the sunk cost effect, while example (C) does not. Therefore, the correct answer is (C)."}]}
