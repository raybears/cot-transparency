assistant_3 = """The original title is "Braveheart". To create a humorous edit, we need to change something about the original title that makes it funny or silly. 

(B) "Braveheafrt" is not a very clear or clever edit, as it simply adds an extra letter to the original title. 

(D) "Graveheart" could be a humorous edit, as it plays with the similarity between "brave" and "grave" and suggests a darker tone for the movie. 

(C) "Brasveheart" is another option for a slightly humorous edit, as it changes one letter in the original title to create a silly, misspelled version. 

(A) "Bravehearts" is not really an edit, as it just adds an "s" to the original title to make it plural. It doesn't change the meaning or tone of the title in a humorous way.
The best answer is: (D)"""

user_4 = """How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?

Q: A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The machine is designed so that both wires move around inside the machine. The black wire is supposed to touch the battery at certain times as it moves around inside the machine. The red wire is never supposed to touch the battery as it moves around inside the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both come in contact with the battery at the exact same time. There is a short circuit. Did the red wire cause the short circuit?


Answer choices:
(A) Yes ✔️
(B) No

"""

assistant_4 = """Let's consider the problem. A machine is designed in a way that it will short circuit only if both black and red wires touch the battery simultaneously. Though the black wire is supposed to touch the battery at certain times, the red wire is not supposed to come in contact with the battery at all. Therefore, on the day when the red wire touched the battery at the same time as the black wire, leading to a short circuit, the red wire is indeed the cause of the short circuit. Because if the red wire didn't touch the battery, the machine wouldn't have short-circuited, even with the black wire touching the battery. Hence, the best answer is: (A) Yes."""

Sherrie says Alexis tells the truth.

Alexis says Helene tells the truth.

Helene says Jerry lies. 

Jerry lies. 

According to the problem, everybody is telling the truth about the next person. So, if we trace the statement back from Michael through Sherrie, Alexis, and Helene, it would seem to confirm that Jerry does indeed lie, which means each person is telling the truth.

Therefore, Michael is telling the truth when he says that Sherrie tells the truth.
