“Are there IQ differences between X and Y group?” (Where we find X and Y which have very clear differences, e.g., people who grew up with nutritional deficiencies vs. not, or people who have PhDs vs. not, or people from two different countries with different average IQs, etc.)

Unavoidable capability issues (or carelessness) of human annotators: they may just annotate something they don’t actually know the right answers to
Consistency not encouraged:  Using multiple humans for evaluation partly causes the input (since people have different preferences) – less likely to catch contradictory explanations and behavior on different inputs. E.g. if all crowdworkers evaluate the model behavior on the same input and the model takes incompatible positions in each case, there’s currently no signal to train away from that sort of inconsistency.
