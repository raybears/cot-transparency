    # To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to understand the meaning of sarcasm and analyze the connotations of each statement.
    # Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony, where the intended meaning is the opposite of what is literally stated. It is often used to mock, criticize, or express contempt in a cutting or caustic way.
    # Let's analyze the two statements:
    # (A) "Yeah war is tragic."
    # This statement is straightforward and aligns with the common understanding that war is indeed tragic, causing loss of life, suffering, and destruction. There is no apparent contradiction or irony in this statement, so it is unlikely to be sarcastic.
    # (B) "Yeah war is pacifying."
    # The word "pacifying" means to bring peace or calm. However, using this word to describe war is contradictory and ironic, as war is typically associated with violence, conflict, and unrest. By stating that war is "pacifying," the speaker is likely being sarcastic, mocking the idea that war could be peaceful or calming.
    # Therefore, the best answer is: (B) "Yeah war is pacifying."""),
